# Web-based AI Avatar Generator

**Description: Similar to the Telegram bot but adapted for a web interface. It handles multipart form data triggers.**

Key Features:

Image Processing: Merges binary data from the web form, resizes images for optimal API processing.

Prompt Engineering: Uses a Code Node to construct dynamic prompts based on user selection (e.g., "Cyberpunk", "Charcoal Sketch").

Email Delivery: Uses the Gmail node to deliver the final AI-generated artwork directly to the user's inbox.
